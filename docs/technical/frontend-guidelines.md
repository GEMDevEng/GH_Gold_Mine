# Frontend Guidelines for GitHub Project Miner

## 1. Introduction
The GitHub Project Miner is a web application that automates the discovery, analysis, validation, and evaluation of abandoned GitHub projects, enabling users to identify high-potential projects for revival at no cost. The frontend, built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), provides an intuitive, responsive, and accessible interface for a diverse audience, including entrepreneurs, developers, investors, open-source enthusiasts, researchers, companies, and students. These guidelines outline the standards and best practices for developing the frontend, ensuring a user-friendly experience, high performance, and maintainability while adhering to a $0 budget using free tools like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 User-Centric Design
- **Target Audience**: The frontend caters to a diverse user base with varying technical expertise, from non-technical entrepreneurs seeking business opportunities to developers analyzing code quality. The design prioritizes simplicity and clarity to accommodate all users.
- **Simplicity**: Interfaces are clean and uncluttered, with minimal steps required to perform tasks like searching for projects or viewing analyses.
- **Consistency**: Uniform styling, typography, and interaction patterns (e.g., button styles, navigation) ensure a cohesive user experience across all screens.
- **Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions (e.g., loading spinners, success/error messages) to enhance usability.

### 2.2 Accessibility
- Comply with [WCAG 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.
- Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`) to support screen readers.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for large text) using tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
- Support full keyboard navigation for all interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links, forms).
- Include ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`) for dynamic content and form inputs.

### 2.3 Responsiveness
- Adopt a mobile-first design approach, ensuring functionality on smartphones (min-width: 320px), tablets, and desktops (max-width: 1920px).
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Test across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices using tools like [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) (free tier for open-source projects).

### 2.4 Performance
- Optimize initial page load to under 3 seconds, targeting a [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) performance score of 90+.
- Minimize asset sizes by compressing images and minifying CSS/JavaScript.
- Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical components using React’s `lazy` and `Suspense`.
- Use code splitting to load only necessary JavaScript chunks, reducing initial bundle size.
- Leverage browser caching for static assets with appropriate cache headers.

## 3. UI/UX Considerations

### 3.1 Color Scheme
- **Primary Colors**:
  - Dark Blue (`#24292e`): For headers, navigation, and backgrounds, inspired by GitHub’s aesthetic.
  - Light Gray (`#f6f8fa`): For secondary backgrounds and cards.
  - White (`#ffffff`): For primary content areas.
  - Green (`#2ea44f`): For positive actions (e.g., “Search”, “Save Project”).
- **Contrast**: Ensure text readability with high contrast (e.g., dark text on light backgrounds).
- **Theme**: Implement light mode only for the MVP to simplify development; dark mode can be added later.

### 3.2 Typography
- **Font Family**: Use system fonts (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif`) for optimal performance and compatibility.
- **Font Sizes**:
  - Headings: `h1` (2.5rem/40px), `h2` (2rem/32px), `h3` (1.75rem/28px).
  - Body text: 1rem (16px).
  - Captions/small text: 0.875rem (14px).
- **Line Height**: 1.5 for body text, 1.2 for headings to ensure readability.
- **Text Alignment**: Left-aligned for most content; center-aligned for headings or CTAs where appropriate.

### 3.3 Layout
- **Grid System**: Use a 12-column CSS Grid for consistent layout across screens.
- **Spacing**:
  - Follow a spacing scale (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px) for margins and paddings to maintain visual harmony.
  - Ensure adequate white space to prevent cluttered interfaces.
- **Navigation**:
  - Fixed top navigation bar with links to Dashboard, Discover, Evaluate, Profile, and Help.
  - Hamburger menu for mobile devices, collapsing into a slide-out menu.
- **Breakpoints**:
  - Mobile: 320px–767px
  - Tablet: 768px–1023px
  - Desktop: 1024px and above

### 3.4 Visual Hierarchy
- Use larger font sizes and bold weights for headings to establish hierarchy.
- Highlight key metrics (e.g., project scores, star counts) with color accents or bold text.
- Design clear CTAs (e.g., “Search Projects”, “Download Report”) with green buttons and hover effects.

### 3.5 User Flows
- **Onboarding**: Display a welcome modal for first-time users with a brief app overview and CTAs for login/signup.
- **Project Discovery**: Allow users to filter projects by domain, language, and inactivity on the Discover page, with results displayed in a sortable table.
- **Project Analysis**: Present analysis results in a tabbed interface on the Project Detail page, with clear sections for code quality, documentation, and community metrics.
- **Evaluation**: Enable side-by-side project comparison on the Evaluate page, with scores and business model recommendations.
- **Profile Management**: Provide a Profile page for users to manage saved projects and settings.

## 4. Component Design

### 4.1 Reusable Components
The frontend uses modular, reusable React components to ensure maintainability and consistency:

| **Component**         | **Description**                                                                 | **Key Features**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NavigationBar         | Fixed top bar for site navigation.                                             | Links to Dashboard, Discover, Evaluate, Profile, Help; hamburger menu for mobile. |
| ProjectCard           | Displays project summary (name, stars, forks, issues, last commit).            | Clickable to view details; hover effects; responsive layout.                     |
| FilterDropdown        | Dropdown for filtering projects by domain, language, inactivity.                | Multi-select options; real-time updates; accessible with keyboard.               |
| TabbedInterface       | Tabs for Project Detail page (Code Quality, Documentation, Community, Legal).   | Smooth tab switching; responsive design; ARIA support.                           |
| ComparisonTable       | Table for comparing multiple projects on Evaluate page.                        | Sortable columns; highlights differences; export option.                         |
| AuthForm              | Login/Signup forms with email/password and GitHub OAuth.                       | Real-time validation; error messages; OAuth button.                              |
| ReportDownloadButton  | Button to download analysis reports as PDF/CSV.                                | Loading state; format selection; shareable link generation.                     |

### 4.2 Component Library
- Use [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for pre-built, accessible components, customized to match the GitHub-inspired color scheme.
- Ensure components are stateless where possible, using props for configuration.
- Implement TypeScript for type safety in component props and state.

### 4.3 Forms
- **Validation**: Use [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for efficient form management and real-time validation.
- **Accessibility**: Include ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`) for form fields.
- **Feedback**: Display loading spinners during form submission and clear success/error messages (e.g., “Login successful”, “Invalid email”).

## 5. State Management

- **Global State**: Use [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for lightweight state management (e.g., user authentication, theme settings).
- **Data Fetching**: Use [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for managing API data, caching, and refetching.
- **Local State**: Use React’s `useState` and `useReducer` for component-specific state (e.g., form inputs, toggle states).
- **Caching**: Cache API responses in memory to reduce redundant calls, especially for GitHub API rate limits (5000 requests/hour).

## 6. Routing

- **Library**: Use [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for client-side routing.
- **Routes**:
  - `/`: Dashboard (redirects to `/discover` if logged in)
  - `/discover`: Project Discovery page
  - `/project/:id`: Project Detail page
  - `/evaluate`: Business Opportunity Evaluation page
  - `/profile`: User Profile page
  - `/login`: Login page
  - `/signup`: Signup page
  - `/help`: Help and Resources page
- **Protected Routes**: Restrict access to `/profile` and`/evaluate` for authenticated users only.
- **Error Handling**: Display a 404 page for invalid routes.

## 7. API Integration

- **Library**: Use [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for API requests due to its robust error handling and interceptors.
- **Endpoints**: Connect to backend microservices (e.g., `/api/projects`, `/api/analyses`) via the API Gateway.
- **Error Handling**: Implement global error handling with user-friendly messages (e.g., “Failed to fetch projects. Try again later.”).
- **Loading States**: Show skeleton loaders or spinners during API calls to enhance UX.
- **Rate Limiting**: Handle GitHub API rate limits by caching responses and displaying warnings when limits are neared.

## 8. Performance Optimization

- **Bundle Size**: Use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling and minification, targeting a bundle size under 500 KB.
- **Image Optimization**: Compress images using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or equivalent before deployment.
- **Code Splitting**: Implement dynamic imports with React’s `lazy` and `Suspense` for non-critical routes (e.g., `/help`).
- **Caching**: Set cache headers for static assets (e.g., `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000`) to leverage browser caching.
- **Critical Rendering Path**: Prioritize above-the-fold content for faster perceived load times.

## 9. Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) to test components and hooks.
- **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components and API calls.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to simulate user flows (e.g., login, project search, report download).
- **Accessibility Testing**: Run [axe-core](https://www.deque.com/axe/) audits during development to ensure WCAG compliance.
- **Performance Testing**: Use [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to monitor performance metrics.

## 10. Deployment

- **Hosting**: Deploy on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) free tiers for static site hosting.
- **CI/CD**: Configure [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for automated testing and deployment on code pushes.
- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in Netlify/Vercel environment variables.
- **Version Control**: Use Git with a monorepo structure (e.g., [Nx](https://nx.dev/)) for managing frontend and shared code.

## 11. Maintenance and Updates

- **Dependency Management**: Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management, with [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) for automated updates.
- **Code Reviews**: Require pull request reviews to maintain code quality.
- **Documentation**: Maintain a `README.md` and inline comments for components, following JSDoc standards.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) (free tier) for error tracking and performance monitoring.
- **User Feedback**: Collect feedback via a simple form on the Help page or [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions).

## 12. Additional Considerations

- **Internationalization**: Prepare for future multi-language support using [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) if global expansion is needed.
- **Analytics**: Integrate [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) (free tier) to track user interactions and improve UX.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure core functionality (e.g., project listing) works without JavaScript for robustness.
- **SEO**: Optimize for search engines with meta tags and a sitemap, using [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).
